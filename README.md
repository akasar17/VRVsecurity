# RBAC Visualization with Three.js

A visually appealing **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** system built using **React** and **Three.js**. This project demonstrates a 3D visualization of roles, users, and permissions, making it intuitive and interactive.

## 🛠️ Features
- **3D Visualization**:
  - Roles represented as spheres.
  - Users represented as smaller spheres.
  - Permissions visualized as connecting lines.
- **Interactive Animations**:
  - Rotating 3D elements for an engaging experience.
- **React Integration**:
  - Uses React for component-based architecture.
- **Dynamic Scalability**:
  - Easily expandable to include more users, roles, and permissions.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later)
- npm or yarn (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/rbac-threejs.git
   cd rbac-threejs
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

### Directory Structure

```

## ✨ How It Works

- **Three.js** is used to create a 3D scene where:
  - Roles are displayed as larger blue spheres.
  - Users are smaller green spheres.
  - Permissions are orange lines connecting roles and users.
- React manages the UI and lifecycle of the 3D visualization.
